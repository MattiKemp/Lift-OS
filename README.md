# Lift-OS
operating system for a raspberry pi with a kinect that allows for voice recognition, facial recognition, and gesture control of ubuntu mate. Designed for use in a weight room where a keyboard and mouse are not optimial.

Current Features:
- facial detection and recognition for logging workout time automatically.
- voice commands for display and closing the camera (used as a mirror for when you are working out).
- voice commands for primitive searching on google and youtube.
- multi-threaded task manager as the user is able to open and close programs with the assistant voice commands.

Future planned features:
- voice commands for advanced searching google and youtube using selenium.
- hand gestures for possible moving windows around, selecting things on the screen such as links to websites, and other system tasks.
- full integration with spotify so that voice commands can be used to skip, restart, or add songs to the current queue.
- user accounts that automatically sync app data (spotify/youtube), a user could log in through facial recognition or through a voice command.
- the ability to open any program on the system with a basic voice command such as: 'please open tetris'

The first commit was written in a little over a week so there is a lot of bad and unused code throughout.
In further iterations these will be removed and code will be refractored.
